# Smart Contract Development Practice: Lottery Contract
This project is a practice of developing smart contracts. 
I used the basic ideas from the lottery contract in the Udemy course below by Stephen Grider but instead of using previous versions of solidity in the course and Truffle, I used newer updated versions of solidity and Hardhat. 

Based on Stephen Grider's course "Ethereum and Solidity: The Complete Developer's Guide"

## Summary 
I used Hardhat as a development environment and wrote smart contracts in solidity, compiled and deployed them on local hardhat network and then wrote my own tests using mocha.
